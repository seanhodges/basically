## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Blocks are part of the document

A document SHALL be its BASIC source plus zero or more named memory blocks
(raw bytes at a fixed address). Blocks SHALL travel with the document through
autosave, save/open, export, and sharing, and SHALL reset when a different
program becomes active.

Where a machine's export format can hold more than the BASIC program, that
export SHALL carry the document's blocks, so a program exported and loaded on
real hardware is the whole program. Where a machine's format has no room for
them, the IDE SHALL say so before exporting rather than dropping them silently.

#### Scenario: Blocks survive a reload

- **WHEN** the user closes and reopens the IDE while a document with blocks
  is autosaved
- **THEN** the blocks are restored with the source

#### Scenario: An export that can carry blocks round-trips

- **WHEN** the user exports a document with blocks in a format that can hold
  them, and imports the exported file back
- **THEN** the source and every block return intact

#### Scenario: An export that cannot carry blocks says so

- **WHEN** the user exports a document with blocks in a format that holds only
  the BASIC program
- **THEN** they are told the blocks will not travel, and choose whether to
  export without them
